# Heart-Disease-Predictions-using-Supervised-Machine-Learning
This machine learning project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on a comprehensive dataset of medical and clinical attributes. Leveraging machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees and  others, a predictive model capable of assessing the risk of heart disease was deployed
